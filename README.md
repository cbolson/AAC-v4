# IMPORTANT

\***\*\*\*\*\*\*** This version is still in development \***\*\*\*\*\*\***

I have made it public so that you can see the progress and make any suggestions you may feel necessary.

NOTES:

- This live version is NOT the latest web component version which is here on Github

Before installing you need rename these files:

DEFAULT-ac-config.inc.php > config.inc.php

DEFAULT-ac.install.php > ac-install.php

## TO DO:

- admin > set availability
- languages > remove/revise unused texts
- documentation
- update ac-install.php to include new text definitions and values
